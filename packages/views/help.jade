            p The annotation interface displays three separate columns: code keywords, the body of the document text, and annotations within the document. On the left-hand side all code keywords are listed in a three-layer hierarchical manner with keywords nested under headers and sub-headers. To expose the keywords within groups and subgroups, click the arrow. You can also search for a specific keyword using the search bar above the keyword groups.

            p To annotate a section of text, highlight the text by selecting it with your mouse. Once you have highlighted the desired text, click on the keyword you would like to annotate with. The text will then be highlighted with the corresponding color of the keyword and a colored annotation will pop up in the right-hand column of the interface. Each annotation shows the coded keyword and the email of the user account that added that annotation.( Note: Annotations added by admin account users will not display the user email.) To view the body of text associated with a specific annotation, simply click on the annotation in the right-hand column and you will be guided to the highlighted text in your document. You will also have the ability to flag specific annotations of particular importance.

            p All activity in the annotation interface is automatically saved to the document.

You also have the ability to search for a specific keyword using the search function in the keyword column. To deselect keywords, click “Clear Selected Codes” in the keyword column.

            p.featured Tater groups are siloed collections of documents. It is important to establish your groups before adding regular (non-admin) Tater users because groups are access-specific; regular Tater users are assigned to a specific group and can only view/edit/delete documents within that specific group. Regular users are not able to access any documents outside of their specific group.
