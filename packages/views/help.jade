            p The annotation interface displays three separate columns: code keywords, the body of the document text, and annotations within the document. On the left-hand side all code keywords are listed in a three-layer hierarchical manner with keywords nested under headers and sub-headers. To hide/expose the keywords within groups and subgroups, click the #[i(class="fa fa-chevron-circle-down" title="Arrow")]. You can also search for a specific keyword using the search bar above the keyword groups.

            p To annotate a section of text, highlight the text by selecting it with your mouse. Once you have highlighted the desired text, click on the keyword with which you would like to annotate. The text will then be highlighted with the corresponding color of the keyword and a colored annotation will appear in the right-hand column of the interface. Each annotation shows the coded keyword and the email of the user account that added that annotation. #[span(class="note") Note: Annotations added by admin account users will not display the user email.]

            p To view the text associated with a specific annotation, simply click on the annotation in the right-hand column and you will be guided to the highlighted text in the document.

          p To view annotated text across documents, click #[span(class="button-ref") Annotations] in the navigation menu. This page displays three separate columns: #[i documents], #[i annotations], and #[i code keywords]. In the #[i documents] column (left) admins see a list of all groups and documents. Regular users see all documents in their group. In the #[i annotations] column (middle) users see a list of annotations from selected groups/documents. In the #[i code keyword] column (right) users see a list of code keywords with which to filter the annotations.

          p To view all of the annotated text in specific documents or document groups, simply click the document name(s) and the annotations will appear in the annotations column. Each annotation includes its code keyword, the specific text annotated from the document, the document name (lower left-hand side) and the user email of the account that created the annotations (lower right-hand side). Annotations are grouped and listed according to keywords.

          p To view all annotations from multiple documents, select all of the documents you are interested in. To deselect a document, simply click on it’s name again. To deselect all documents, click the #[i(class="fa fa-times-circle" title="Remove")] button found to the right of the Documents column title.

          p Once you have selected the documents you are interested in, you can filter the annotations by keyword. To only see annotations of a specific code keyword header, sub-header or keyword itself, click on the keyword in the right-hand column. You also have the ability to search for a specific keyword using the search function in the keyword column. To deselect keywords, click #[span(class="button-ref") Clear Selected Codes] in the keyword column.

        .help-topic-group#user-types
          h2 User Types
          p There are two types of Tater users: Admin users and Regular users. Admin users have the capability to create and manage multiple different Tater projects and are typically Principal Investigators or Project/Program Coordinators. Regular users are assigned to a specific Tater project and are only able view, annotate and analyze documents within that project. Admin user accounts differ from regular user accounts in several ways:

          table.table
            thead
              th Admin Users
              th Regular Users

        .help-topic-group#group-management
          h2 Document Group Management
          p.featured Tater groups are siloed collections of documents. It is important to establish your groups before adding regular users. Regular users are assigned to a specific group and can only view/edit/delete documents within that specific group. Regular users are not able to access any documents outside of their specific group.

          .help-topic#creating-groups

            p To add a group, navigate to the Admin page and click the button #[span(class="button-ref") Create] next to the #[i Document Groups] section title. You will be directed to a new page where you must enter the group Name. You may also include a short description of the group in the #[i Description] section on this page. Once you have created a group, you can begin creating regular Tater user accounts.

To add any level, click on the #[i(class="fa fa-plus" title="Plus")] icon at the upper-right corner of the code’s column. Enter a name and click the add button. Header’s require a color which will represent its coding keywords throughout the application. Select a color by clicking one of the colored boxes.

            p If a coding keyword has not been used to annotate a document, it can be deleted by clicking on the #[i(class="fa fa-trash" class="Trash Can")] icon. Otherwise the keyword will be archived. Archived codes remain in the application, but moved to the bottom of the list and grayed on the coding keyword page. They are also removed from the list available codes in the annotation interface and thus unavailable for annotating future documents.

            p If a header is archived, all of its sub-headers and their keywords will be archived and removed from the list of codes available for annotating documents.

          .help-topic#unarchiving-coding-keywords
            h3 Unarchiving
            p In the event the decision is made to revive an archived header, sub-header or code in the future, simply unarchive by clicking the #[i(class="fa fa-mail-reply" title="Unarchive")] icon. If unarchiving a coding keyword, the code will then become available in the annotation interface. When unarchiving header or sub-headers, the header and all associated coding keywords  will become available.
