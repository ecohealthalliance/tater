On the left-hand side all code keywords are listed in a three-layer hierarchical manner with keywords nested under headers and sub-headers. To expose the keywords within groups and subgroups, click the arrow. You can also search for a specific keyword using the search bar above the keyword groups.

            p There are two types of Tater users: Admin users and Regular users. Admin users have the capability to create and manage multiple different Tater projects and are typically Principal Investigators or Project/Program Coordinators. Regular users are assigned to a specific Tater project and are only able view, annotate and analyze documents within that project. Admin Tater user accounts differ from regular Tater user accounts in several ways:

            h2 Group Management
            p.featured Tater groups are siloed collections of documents. It is important to establish your groups before adding regular (non-admin) Tater users because groups are access-specific; regular Tater users are assigned to a specific group and can only view/edit/delete documents within that specific group. Regular users are not able to access any documents outside of their specific group.

You will be directed to a new page where you must enter the group Name. You may also include a short description of the group in the #[i Description] section on this page. Once you have created a group, you can begin creating regular Tater user accounts.

              h4 Creating Regular Users
              p To add a regular Tater user, navigate to the Groups section on the Admin page. Decide which group you would like to add a user to and click the #[i(class='fa fa-user-plus')] icon on the right-hand side aligned with that specific group. Enter the new email and a temporary password. Send the new user individual their temporary password and instruct them to log into Tater and update their password.

              h4 Removing Users
              p To remove a user, navigate to the Admin page and scroll down to the #[i Users] section. Click the #[i(class='fa fa-user-times')] on the righthand side aligned with the individual user you wish to remove.

Archived codes remain in the application, but moved to the bottom of the list and grayed on the coding keyword page. They are also removed from the list available codes in the annotation interface and thus unavailable for annotating future documents.

              p If a header is archived, all of its sub-headers and their keywords will be archived and removed from the list of available codes used to annotate a document.

If unarchiving a coding keyword, the code will then become available in the annotation interface. When unarchiving header or sub-headers, the header and all associated coding keywords  will become available.
