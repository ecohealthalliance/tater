            p.featured There are two types of Tater users: Admin users and Regular users. Admin users have the capability to create and manage multiple different Tater document groups and are typically Principal Investigators or Project/Program Coordinators. Regular users are assigned to a specific Tater document group and are only able view, annotate and analyze documents within that group. Admin user accounts differ from regular user accounts in several ways:
